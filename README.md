# discord-controller

This is an open source, python based computer controller. It works with a discord bot that is simple to use.

Commands include:
* /upload with the ability to put it in the temp files folder, desktop or downloads (more coming) and to choose whether you'd like to run after upload or not.
* /cmd allows you to run commands silently with output
* /screenshot gives you a real-time screenshot of the client's screen
* /exit just terminates the process
* /debug lists process info
* /update checks for new update and updates if necessary

Other features:
* No antivirus worries (atleast for Windows defender which is basically enough tbf) since the installer adds the folder as an exclusion.
* Runs on startup
* Update checking

Next updates will include:
* Active updater included (Done)
* Ability to see screen in real time (In progress)
* Task manager activites (can already do with /cmd)
* Notifying when one goes online
* Ability for more than one client

**Usage:**
* Download the installer from this directory and run it and it'll do everything for you.
